## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests with UI (interactive mode)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run tests in headed mode (visible browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Debug specific test
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Run both unit and E2E tests
npm run test:all
```

## Test Configuration

## Browser Support

Tests run on:
- **Chromium** (Desktop Chrome)
- **Firefox** (Desktop Firefox)  
- **Webkit** (Desktop Safari)

Mobile browser testing can be enabled by uncommenting the mobile configurations in `playwright.config.ts`.

## Test Strategy

These tests focus on **user journeys** rather than isolated component testing:

1. **Critical Path Coverage** - All essential user workflows are tested
2. **Performance Validation** - Ensures the app meets performance requirements
3. **Cross-Browser Compatibility** - Validates functionality across browsers
4. **Accessibility Compliance** - Basic accessibility checks included
5. **Real User Scenarios** - Tests simulate actual user behavior patterns

## Debugging Failed Tests

1. **HTML Reports** - Check `playwright-report/` for detailed results
2. **Traces** - Inspect traces for failed tests in the report
3. **Screenshots** - Failure screenshots are automatically captured
4. **Debug Mode** - Use `npm run test:e2e:debug` for step-by-step debugging
5. **UI Mode** - Use `npm run test:e2e:ui` for interactive test running

## Maintenance

- **Selector Updates** - Update `fixtures/testData.ts` when UI changes
- **Test Data** - Modify sample ICS content as needed for new features
- **Browser Coverage** - Adjust browser configurations in `playwright.config.ts`
- **Performance Thresholds** - Update timing expectations in performance tests as needed

These tests ensure the Linear Calendar delivers a fast, reliable, and user-friendly experience across all supported platforms and use cases.
