# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server on port 3000
- `npm run build` - Build for production (runs Vite build + TypeScript compilation)
- `npm run test` - Run Vitest tests
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run format` - Run Prettier
- `npm run check` - Auto-fix with Prettier and ESLint

**IMPORTANT: Testing Requirements**
- **Always run tests before committing**: Use `npm run test` to ensure all tests pass
- **Add tests for new functionality**: When adding features or fixing bugs, include appropriate test coverage
- **Update existing tests**: When modifying components or hooks, ensure tests reflect the changes
- **Test both unit and integration**: Tests are located in `src/__tests__/` with subdirectories for `components/`, `hooks/`, `utils/`, and `integration/`

## Git Workflow and Branch Management

**IMPORTANT**: When implementing new features or fixing bugs, always use feature branches:

1. **Check Current Branch**: Before starting work, verify you're not on `main`
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```

2. **Create Feature Branch**: If on `main` or need a new branch for your work
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name  # e.g., feature-name, fix-bug-name, etc.
   ```

3. **Work and Commit**: Make your changes and commit to the feature branch
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   ```

4. **Push and Create PR**: Push the branch and create a pull request
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-name
   ```

5. **Merge**: Only merge to `main` after code review via pull request

**Branch Naming Convention**:
- `feature-*` for new features (e.g., `feature-event-details`)
- `fix-*` for bug fixes (e.g., `fix-calendar-scroll`)
- `update-*` for updates/improvements (e.g., `update-performance`)

**Never commit directly to `main`** - always use feature branches for development work.

## Architecture

This is a React application built with:

- **Vite** as the build tool and dev server
- **TanStack Router** for file-based routing with automatic code splitting
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling
- **TypeScript** with strict mode enabled
- **Vitest** for testing with jsdom environment

### Key Architecture Points

- **File-based routing**: Routes are defined as files in `src/routes/` directory
- **Route tree generation**: TanStack Router automatically generates `routeTree.gen` from route files
- **Layout system**: Root layout is in `src/routes/__root.tsx` with `<Outlet />` for route content
- **Type safety**: Router instance is registered globally for TypeScript inference
- **Path aliases**: `@/*` maps to `./src/*` for imports

### Router Configuration

The router is configured with:

- Intent-based preloading
- Scroll restoration
- Structural sharing enabled
- Zero preload stale time

### Testing Setup

- Uses Vitest with jsdom environment
- Testing utilities: `@testing-library/react` and `@testing-library/dom`
- Global test configuration in `vite.config.js`
- Test files organized in `src/__tests__/` with subdirectories for components, utils, and integration tests
- Mock fixtures in `src/__tests__/fixtures/` for testing with sample data
- Component tests include EventSearch and EventDetailsModal with map link functionality

### Performance Architecture

This application features comprehensive performance optimization and monitoring:

- **Web Vitals monitoring** with real-time console logging (FCP, LCP, CLS, INP, TTFB)
- **Performance dashboard** accessible via blue activity icon (top-right corner)
- **React.memo optimization** for CalendarMonth and CalendarDay components
- **useMemo optimization** for expensive date calculations and event processing
- **Progressive loading system** with branded 5-stage initialization
- **Custom performance timers** for modal interactions and page load tracking
- **Memoized component architecture** prevents unnecessary re-renders

## CalDAV Integration Architecture

This application features a sophisticated CalDAV integration for live Apple Calendar synchronization:

### CalDAV Proxy Server

- **Express.js backend** in `caldav-proxy/` directory
- **Tech stack**: Express, tsdav, ical, cors
- **Purpose**: Handles Apple Calendar authentication and data fetching via CalDAV protocol
- **Deployment**: Configured for Railway with health checks

### Key CalDAV Files

- `caldav-proxy/server.js` - Main proxy server handling CalDAV requests
- `src/utils/caldavUtils.ts` - Client-side CalDAV utility functions
- `src/hooks/useCalDAVImport.ts` - React hook for CalDAV imports
- `src/hooks/useAutoRefresh.ts` - Auto-refresh functionality for live updates

### CalDAV Proxy Commands

- `cd caldav-proxy && npm install` - Install proxy dependencies
- `cd caldav-proxy && npm run dev` - Start proxy in development mode
- `cd caldav-proxy && npm start` - Start proxy in production mode

### CalDAV Configuration

- **Development**: Proxy runs on port 3001, UI on port 3000
- **Production**: Environment variable `CALDAV_PROXY_URL` points to deployed proxy
- **Authentication**: Uses Apple app-specific passwords for secure access
- **Timezone**: Defaults to Europe/London, configurable via UI

### CalDAV Features

- Multi-calendar support with statistics
- Recurring event handling with RRULE parsing across multiple years
- All-day event detection and proper display
- Timezone-aware event processing
- Auto-refresh with configurable intervals
- Multi-year event support (2024, 2025, 2026+)

## Multi-Year Architecture

The calendar supports infinite scroll across multiple years with the following architecture:

### Date Range Management

- **Initial Load**: Starts with `currentYear Â± 1` (e.g., 2024 shows 2023-2025)
- **Infinite Scroll**:
  - Scrolling near top adds `startYear - 1`
  - Scrolling near bottom adds `endYear + 1`
- **Jump to Today**: Expands range to include current year if not already loaded
- **Navigation**: Expands range to include any selected year

### Event Processing

- **CalDAV Imports**: `importFromCalDAV(credentials, startYear, endYear)` processes events for full displayed range
- **ICS File Processing**: `parseICSFile(content, startYear, endYear)` handles multi-year imports
- **Recurring Events**: `expandRecurringEvent(event, startYear, endYear)` generates occurrences across all years
- **Auto-refresh**: Uses current date range for live updates
