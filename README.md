## 🎯 Why Linear Calendar?

Traditional calendar views (month grids) can be challenging for people with ADHD or time management difficulties. This linear approach provides:

- **Clear time progression** - see exactly where you are in the year
- **Reduced cognitive load** - simple, consistent layout
- **Physical interaction** - print and physically cross off days
- **Progress visualization** - see how much of the year has passed
- **Context preservation** - events show in relation to the full year
